# learn-ai
## Introduction
Welcome to my repo where I store my AI learning journey. This repo will likely contain my notes of various courses, articles and videos I consume. 

## Goals
As of today April 14, 2024, my current goal is to:
- Build a foundational and confident understanding of the AI space (non technical deep dive)

Based off my first goal listed above, I will explore and reassess how and where I would like to take my AI learning journey. 
For example:
- How do I want to expand and apply AI knowledge in my current cloud & developer career?
- How techincal of a deep dive do I want to learn and apply AI in my career?
- Do I want to transform my career again, this time into the AI space?
