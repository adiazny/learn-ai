### Generating text using Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are built by using supervised learning (Aâ†’B) **to repeatedly predict the next word.**

When we train a very large AI system on a lot of data (hundreds of billions of words), 
we get a Large Language Model like ChatGPT.

LLMs can make facts up which is called hallucination.

### AI is a general purpose technology

Writng, reading and chating tasks

Web-based vs. software application use of LLMs

Web-based interface applications e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini, or Bing Chat

Software-based applications e.g. email routing, document search
