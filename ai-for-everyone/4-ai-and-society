# AI and Society


## A realistic view of AI 

### Goldilocks rule for AI

* Too optimistic: AI will solve all of humanity’s problems and create utopia
* Too pessimistic: Super intelligent/sentient killer AI can lead to human extinction
* Just right: AI is a powerful tool, but has limitations. We can mitigate its potential harms and use it to create tremendous value.

### Limitations of AI
* Performance limitations
* Explainability is hard (but sometimes doable)

### Limitations of AI
* Biased AI through biased data
* Adversarial attacks on AI


## Discrimination / Bias

* Man : Woman as Father: Mother
* Man : Woman as King: Queen
* Man : Computer programmer as Woman : Homemaker Computer programmer

### Why bias matters
* Hiring tool that discriminated against women
* Facial recognition matching dark skinned individuals to criminal mugshots 
* Bank loan approvals
* Toxic effect of reinforcing unhealthy stereotypes

### Combating bias
* Technical solutions:
    - E.g., “zero out” the bias in words
    - Use less biased and/or more inclusive data
* Transparency and/or auditing processes
* Diverse workforce
    - Creates less biased applications


## Adversarial attacks on AI

- minor perturbation (small change to the pixel value)
    - an almost imperceptible change to most people
- physical attacks: e.g. adding phycical objects to an image to have AI system to think it is something else than the actual picture

- Defenses do exist, but incur some cost


## Adverse uses of AI

- DeepFakes
    - Synthesize video of people doing things they never did
- Undermining of democracy and privacy
    - Oppressive monitoring of individuals
- Generating fake comments
- Spam vs. anti-spam and fraud vs. anti-fraud

## AI and developing economies

“leapfrog”
-Mobile phones
-Mobile payments
-Online education

- The US, China, UK, Canada, and many others have vibrant AI communities. But all countries still have a lot of development ahead
- Focus on AI to strengthen a country’s vertical industries
- Public-private partnerships to accelerate development
